The basic strategy is cards 2 - 6 are worth = +1, 7 - 9 are worth = 0, 10 - A are worth = -1. The idea is the higher the count the more you should bet because of the higher probability of cards 10-A showing up.
This is a basic backend for the program I am developing. I would like to add more functionality and go more in depth with the way 21 is played. I also want to add a JFrame to this system to get more of a visual
representation when practicing the game.
